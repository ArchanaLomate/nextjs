How could we improve or alter this familiarization exercise? 
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  I am genuinely impressed with the structure of the exercise. The sequence of questions is designed in such a way that it gradually guides you through without overwhelming you with too much information at once, preparing you for more complex questions later on.
      </p>
        <p>
 Moreover, it's an effective method for introducing potential employees to our platform and other tools they'll be using regularly.
     </p>
        <p>
        Additionally, it serves as a useful gauge of areas where candidates may need to improve
